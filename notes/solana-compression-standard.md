## A standard for state compression applications

### Overview

Presently, we have witnessed the advent of NFT state compression. Should one desire to incorporate state compression into their application, they would need to gain support from RPC providers. However, what if there were a standard whereby an RPC provider could readily include a configuration, thereby adding your state compression application? This could be akin to the effect ERC20s had on tokens within exchanges.
