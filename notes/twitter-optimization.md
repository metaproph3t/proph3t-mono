# How to optimize Twitter engagement

## Synthesis

General strategy:
1. Twitter is an information market. Users trade attention and retweets for information that enhances their life in some way.
2. Just like in product markets, 95% of the time people will continue going back to the same producers. But still, people will make some attempt at utility maximization. Hence, if you consistently provide valuable information, eventually engagement will follow.
3. The caveat to this is that people need to find your 'information shop' in the first place. There's really only one way to go about this: engaging in public spaces. On Twitter, this means writing value-added replies to tweets of accounts with > 2k followers. Off Twitter, this could be talking on Discord, at IRL or virtual conferences, etc.
4. Starting out, you should be spending 30% of effort on producing high-value content and 70% on engaging in public spaces.
5. Once you get more followers, you can shift time & energy towards producing high-value content. You'll no longer be 'Tweeting into a void.'
6. Like in the economy, specialization is key. Pick at most 3 buckets to focus on. For me, these are organizations, Solana, and DeFi. In my case, they are all heavily-related, and so it's okay. What's not okay is a mix of unconnected interests like epistemology, make-up tutorials, and exotic derivatives. 
7. Connected to this, a broader point: know your market! Who are you trying to attract? What would they be interested in? Unless you are already a celebrity or notable person (e.g., Elon Musk), you are unlikely to build engagement unless you know your market. For me, the market is: clear thinkers in the Solana / crypto community that are excited about building a better world. That's a very niche market! Consider that Anatoly has ~230k followers on Twitter, so let's say 250k Solana community members. Probably only 10% are clear thinkers, and of those, maybe 20% are either excited about building a better world or are long-term pragmatic (as opposed to being engaging in short-term games like MEV). So my market is probably between 1-10k people. Better to kill a 1-10k market than picking a huge market (e.g., business) where you're likely not going to add much value.

Attracting followers as a funnel:
- # of people who see your replies * percentage who find them interesting = # of people who look at your profile
- # of people who look at your profile * profile conversion rate = new followers

In that sense, you are trying to maximize three things simultaneously:
- The number of impressions your replies garner
- The likelihood that someone will find your reply interesting
- The likelihood that someone looking at your profile will decide to follow

To maximize the first, do the following:
- Reply at least 5 times a day to accounts in your niche with > 2k followers.

To maximize the second, do the following:
- Stay away from generic 'cool tweet', '100%', 'I agree' replies. 
- Also stay away from paraphrasing what the original tweeter said.
- Try adding value to the conversation.
- Also, as a bonus, your tweet should be able to stand on its own, since this increases the probability that they will retweet it.

To maximize the third:
- Use a humanoid-looking profile pic. Preferably something eye-catching, different, and memorable (NFT PFPs are horrible, contrary to popular belief).
- Try to not change your profile pic. This is like how the most effective branding is simply showing your brand to a potential customer many times. Since people remember the profile pic more than the name, every time you reset it you're resetting this effect back to 0.
- Heavily optimize your bio. It is completely rational to spend multiple hours on this task, given how important it is. Think of your bio less as 'who am I' and more of 'why you should follow me.' If you talk about who you are, it should be less about interests and more about things that give you credibility or signal that you are a part of a community. Anatoly's bio is actually a perfect example of what you shouldn't do: "Wartime OSS maintainer. Co-founder of Solana Labs. Follows, retweets, likes are not endorsements. NFA, only guarantee is risk. Be kind!" There is only one line in there that tells me why I should follow: "Co-founder of Solana Labs." The rest is noise (and may be necessary from a legal perspective, but still hurts conversions). Mert's is much better: "co-founder & ceo @heliuslabs, spellbook: http://helius.xyz — ex @coinbase — building cool toys for crypto devs." Why? 'co-founder & ceo' = importance-signaling, 'ex @coinbase' = credibility-signaling, 'building cool toys for crypto devs' = who should follow and why. The Helius link is not necessary but at the end of the day, he's trying to drive engagement towards Helius. 
- I am currently less clear on what makes a good background photo but you should at least have one. In mert's case, the background image is Helius branding, which signals that Helius is a real thing (which boosts his credibility, as CEO).

Other tactics:
- Twitter rewards those who are consistent. Be consistent. At least twice a day posting, at least five times a day replying.
- Provide valuable content 80% of the time and self-promote (talk about what you're working on) 20% of the time (nothing magical about these numbers, just a general rule of thumb).
- ABC, Always Be Compressing. When someone is on Twitter, their attention span for ideas is tiny. You have maybe 1 second for a tweet, a minute for a thread, and a few minutes for a blog post. Act accordingly.
- Use a Tweet scheduler.


## Raw notes

Source #1:
- Engagement begets engagement - the more followers you have, the higher probability of one of your tweets going viral, which will attract more followers, and so on
- Identify top profiles in the space
 - Look for any patterns or 'lowest common denominators' between their tweets
- Reply either to these top profiles or to people who respond to them
- Advanced search for people trying to solve the problem you solve, and then reply to them
- Use polls

Source #2:
- Choose a niche and concept for the account
- Make a list of other accounts in your niche that are similar to yours
 - Engage with these people
 - Very solid and valuable replies; no paraphrasing, only adding-on
- Be interesting, provide value, and be authentic (this means deciding on a voice)
- Join a community, otherwise you are tweeting into the void
- Have a profile that converts
 - profile photo, header, and bio
 - look at successful accounts and see what their profiles are doing
 - bio needs to tell potential follower what they what would get
 - also needs to give credibility
- Learn how to craft your Tweets
 - Look great
 - Good structure
 - Pleasing to read
- Write a lot of Tweets
- Save successful Tweets that you like to give you inspiration
- Be consistent - doesn't work if you randomly post every few days or weeks

Source #3:
- Start by creating a list of people who get a lot of engagement to reply to, make sure it's private
- Add at least 50 people to the engagement list, follow them and get notified when they Tweet (that way you can be first to the scene)
- Don't reply to old Tweets, reply to new tweets
- Use Hypefury
- Always add value
- Try to reply at least 20 times per day
- Find topics
- Good to have a high like / comment ratio 
- Below 100 followers, you really only want to post 1-2 times per day
- Once someone follows you, make sure you DM them. Never ask for anything
- People are on Twitter for free knowledge transfer
- Don't go over 20-Tweet threads
- Ending retweet should ask to follow & ask to retweet
- Look at analytics and what has done well
- DM people, even ask people for expertise, then tag them in the thread
- Do a thread at least once a week

Source #4:
- create an inviting high-res profile picture, people like to interact with people, not companies
- you want a high-res background photo
- posting 2-6 times per day is optimal
- figure out: who is your audience? What would be the thing that they would want to see?
- people are on Twitter for an average of 3 minutes, you want to post when they're up
- A/B test tweets
- optimizing posting times
- Twitter shows you things that get a lot of engagement
- videos are retweeted 6 times more than photos
- post valuable content 80% of the time, self-promotion 20% of the time
