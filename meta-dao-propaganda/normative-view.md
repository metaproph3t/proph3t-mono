# Why build the Meta-DAO (Part 1)

*There are two ways to view things: normatively and positively. When you look at something normatively, you try determine what **should** be the case. When you look at something positively, you try to determine what **is or will be** the case. This post will be normative and the following post will be positive.*

We live in an age of corrupt institutions. Institutions that reward those who capture credit more than those who create value. Institutions that are dominated by a few elite who use their power to create local benefits despite greater global costs.

Consider the following forces shaping our world:
- Incument firms and regulators collude to stifle new innovation.[^1]
- Management teams and boards of directors focus more on optics than creating shareholder value.[^2]
- Politicians do whatever it takes to remain in power, even if this means crippling their country / province / state with debt.[^3]
- Institutional investors optimize for factors other than risk-adjusted returns, such as status and whether they will be blamed if an investment goes sour.[^4]

Professional managers, board members, institutional investors, and politicians are more alike than you might think. All ostensibly serve the interests of a group. All really serve their own interests. Sometimes the two can align

In each of these cases, the person or people taking the action benefit from their action, but the group as a whole loses. 

When a system is broken, you have three main options to choose from:
1. Continue on with life but adopt a more cynical attitude.
2. Reform the existing system.
3. Build an alternative system. 

We adopt #3. We will build a new system for coordinating humans in technology production and wealth creation. We will call it the Meta-DAO.

[^4]: The two things that they need to worry about are activist investors and lawsuits. Both of these factors incentivize management teams and the boards of directors to avoid risky but potentially beneficial projects. If a risky project goes well, the board sees little financial upside. If it goes poorly, they may be sued.
