## Why build the Meta-DAO (Part 1)

Are you tired of being held back by traditional institutions that prioritize bureaucracy over individual autonomy and rational decision-making? Join us on a journey to explore the potential of the Meta-DAO, a new organization that uses code and markets to make decisions instead of professional managers. 

In this series, we will cover the following topics, with one post per topic:
- **Problem and prior approaches**: What is the problem that all institutions need to solve? What have been prior approaches to the problem?
- **Mechanics**: How does the Meta-DAO solve the problem?
- **Roadmap**: How will we get there? How can you benefit by engaging, and how would you do so?
