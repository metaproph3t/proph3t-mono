Hello,

My name is Proph3t, and I am one of the contributors to the Meta-DAO.

In a sentence, the Meta-DAO is a network state that intends to perform many of the same functions as corporations or governments, only much better. These existing legacy institutions are plagued by conformity and misaligned incentives. We believe that it is time for a great leap forward in human coordination, in the form of an organization that can organize itself in a radically more rational and free way.

The Meta-DAO will work as a collection of many DAOs called member DAOs. Each member will manage a single product or service. For example, if Sushi was a Meta-DAO, there would be a member for Sushiswap, a member for Kashi, et cetera. As in existing DAOs, actions will be proposed and executed in the form of improvement proposals. 

Unlike in existing DAOs, there will be no voting. Instead, investors will bet on whether an improvement proposal will benefit or hurt each member (if you are familiar with Robin Hanson's futarchy, this is based on that). For example, investors could collectively bet that an improvement proposal would deliver +$5M value to Sushiswap but remove -$2M value from Kashi. After 10 days, an algorithm will add together these expected impacts, in this case doing +$5M + -$2M = +$3M. The algorithm then passes the protocol if, and only if, the sum is positive.

In other words, the algorithm is optimizing for 'the greatest good for the greatest number.' This is theoretically what management teams of companies *should* be doing, but their own conformity or career risk often gets in the way. For example, corporate managers are often reluctant to back high-risk projects, even if they are +EV, because of the resultant career risk. Obviously, the Meta-DAO's algorithm would not have this principal-agent problem.

As stated above, the Meta-DAO is intended to be radically better than existing institutions. We are not interested in emulating existing DAO projects that just tweak the names of corporate roles to make them sound more appealing. We want to build an organization that lets people reach their full potential.

We are looking for early contributors who share our vision. If you are a critical thinker who's focused on the long-term and willing to put in the work to make this project a success, you could be a great fit. As with any early project, there are significant risks. But the upside is that by joining early you would have the opportunity to both amass significant wealth and to change the way the world works in a big way.

If you understand what we are trying to achieve, you understand that raising venture funding would compromise decentralization. As such, you would be making the trade that any co-founder makes: forsaking salary now in the hopes of amassing a large fortune in the future. 

The benefit of this is that it ensures that we attract only people who really believe in the Meta-DAO's vision. Pie-growers instead of pie-slicers. 0-to-1ers instead of 1-to-ners.

If this sounds like you, please reach out. And even if you're not interested, consider forwarding this message to someone who might be a good fit.
